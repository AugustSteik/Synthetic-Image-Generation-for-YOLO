# Synthetic-Image-Generation-for-YOLOV8
A tool for generating domain randomised, labelled synthetic images formatted for YOLOV8. Any number of backgrounds and HDRI images for lighting may be used. This repository currently contains the code for the tool and instructions on how to create a basic dataset of 9 images. Following the submission of the paper related to this tool, the following will be added to this repository:

- Instructions on how to install the related software (Blender, VS Code & Anaconda) and configure them with the tool
- A copy of the master file that needs to be saved locally - the tool will use this file to load in backgrounds etc and save images
- Explanation of how each function works to facilitate further tool development
