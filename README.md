A tool for generating domain randomised, labelled synthetic images formatted for YOLOV8. Any number of backgrounds and HDRI images for lighting may be used. This repository currently contains the code for the tool and instructions on how to create a basic dataset of 9 images. Following the submission of the paper related to this tool, the following will be added to this repository:

- Instructions on how to install the related software (Blender, VS code & Anaconda) and configure them with the tool
- Explanation of how each function works to promote further tool development
